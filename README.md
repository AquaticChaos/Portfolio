The contents of this portfolio is comprised of multiple programs in different languages done since my time at the University of Louisville, starting with the Summer 2022 semester and (currently) up to the Fall 2024 semester.
While there were additional programs from when I studied at Jefferson Community & Technical College from Fall 2018 to Fall 2021, unfortunately those files have been corrupted and unrecoverable.

The files will be organized first by programming language, then by semester, then by class.
