--Group 3
--Overall Grading: 66.9 / 75; 89%
--Well done! Be sure to use the correct date and year for some of the queries


--1. List the customers from California who bought red mountain bikes in September 2003. 
--Use order date as date bought. Multi-color bikes with red are considered red bikes.
SELECT CU.CUSTOMERID, CU.LASTNAME, CU.FIRSTNAME, BI.MODELTYPE, PA.COLORLIST, ORDERDATE, SALESTATE
	FROM BIKE..CUSTOMER CU INNER JOIN BIKE..Bicycle BI ON CU.CustomerID = BI.CustomerID
		INNER JOIN BIKE..Paint PA ON BI.PaintID=PA.PaintID
			WHERE PA.ColorList LIKE '%RED%'
				AND BI.ModelType LIKE '%MOUNTAIN%'
					AND SaleState ='CA'
						AND YEAR(BI.OrderDate) = '2003' AND MONTH(BI.OrderDate)=09;

--Group 3: 5/5, the query gives the correct output


--2. List the employees who sold race bikes shipped to Wisconsin without the help of a retail store in 2001, 
--Without help of retail store means rders completed without the help of a retail store are walk-in or direct sales.
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.LastName, b.SaleState, b.ModelType, b.StoreID, b.OrderDate
FROM Bicycle b inner join Employee e on e.EmployeeID = b.EmployeeID
WHERE modeltype = 'race' and SaleState = 'wi' and OrderDate like '%2001%';

--Group 3: 4.8/5, technically the right answer, but you didn't filter the StoreID to be 1, 2, or NULL


--3. List all of the (distinct) rear derailleurs installed on road bikes sold in Florida in 2002.
--ComponentID	ManufacturerName	ProductNumber
SELECT DISTINCT COMP.COMPONENTID, MAN.ManufacturerNAME, ProductNumber

WHERE City.State = 'Ca' AND YEAR(Bicycle.OrderDate) = '2003'
GROUP BY RetailStore.StoreID, RetailStore.StoreName,RetailStore.CityID;

--Group 3: 3.5/5, the query gives the incorrect output (too many stores, not sorted by sale price sum descending if keeping them all)

		WHERE FrameSize ='54'
			AND ModelType ='ROAD'
				AND YEAR(StartDate) = 1999;

--Group 3: 4.8/5, the query almost gives the correct output. Use OrderDate instead of StartDate.

WHERE Bicycle.StartDate = '2003'
GROUP BY Paint.PaintID , Paint.ColorName
ORDER BY Count(Bicycle.SerialNumber) DESC;

--Group 3: 2.5/5, the query gives the incorrect output
--Use OrderDate instead of StartDate
--Use the year 2002 instead of 2003
--Be sure to filter by English letter style!

									FROM BIKE..Bicycle
										WHERE ModelType LIKE '%RACE%'
											AND YEAR(OrderDate) = 2003);

--Group 3: 2.5/5, the query gives the incorrect output
