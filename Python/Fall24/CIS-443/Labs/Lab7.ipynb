    "Find your favorite restaurant on <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/\" target=\"blank\">Yelp</a> and copy the text of two reviews, ideally one positive and one negative. In the code cell below, write Python code to create two TextBlobs using the text of each review. For each review, calculate and display the sentiment of each review as a whole and of each sentence in the reviews (as in Section 12.2.5 of the text). Use TextBlob's default sentiment analyzer. Print each review and each sentence along with its associated sentiment to make it easy to see if the calculated sentiment matches your expectations.\n",
